# Hey, Iâ€™m Javi,

#### I have a passion for learning, and coding is a never ending list of new things to learn...</h4>
Currently, I am learning front-end and back-end web-development. Specifically, JavaScript, SQL, and Python. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon...
I have gotten my hand plenty dirty with HTML and CSS. (this list will grow)

#### Here's my website :)
<sup>(still work in progress sorry)</sup>
